# MPJ-Project
This project is aiming to experience how to use the ideas of the high performance computing platform (Spartan) to solve huge problems based on using Message-Passing Interface meanwhile finding and analyzing the
difference between different shell configurations.
  
In this project, the main task is to program MPI based software to collect the occurrence of the target string in a huge Twitter data-set (10G), while setting up three different Spartan scripts with different nodes and different cores to compare the different execution times.
